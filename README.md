## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

My name is MÃ¡rcio Chingi and I'm from Angola ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡´

My journey in tech world just started in February of 2024 and I still have a long path to make and a lot to get familiarized with (ğŸ˜…) so I hope get more involved within tech communities in order to learn and improve my skills.
Currently I am cadet at 42 Luanda.
